# 🚀 HTTP Server – CodeCrafters Challenge  

[![progress-banner](https://backend.codecrafters.io/progress/http-server/96da4de6-37e4-455d-967c-ce46f53d0551)](https://app.codecrafters.io/users/codecrafters-bot?r=2qF)  

This repository contains my implementation of an **HTTP/1.1 server**, built as part of the [CodeCrafters HTTP Server Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview).  

The goal was to **understand and implement key HTTP features** from scratch, handling requests, responses, and concurrent connections just like a real-world server.

## 🏗 Features  

✔ **Listens on a specified port**  
✔ **Handles multiple client connections**  
✔ **Parses HTTP requests and headers**  
✔ **Responds with appropriate HTTP status codes**  
✔ **Serves static files**  
✔ **Reads request bodies for POST requests**

## ✅ Completed Stages  

- **Port Binding** – Open a TCP socket and listen for connections  
- **Basic HTTP Response** – Return a `200 OK`  
- **URL Path Extraction** – Parse and respond based on the request path  
- **Response Body Handling** – Send meaningful responses  
- **Header Parsing** – Read and interpret incoming request headers  
- **Concurrent Connections** – Handle multiple clients simultaneously  
- **Serving Files** – Return static files from the server  
- **Processing Request Bodies** – Handle incoming `POST` request data
