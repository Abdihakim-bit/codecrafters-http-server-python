[![progress-banner](https://backend.codecrafters.io/progress/http-server/96da4de6-37e4-455d-967c-ce46f53d0551)](https://app.codecrafters.io/users/codecrafters-bot?r=2qF)  

This repository contains my solution for the **["Build Your Own HTTP Server"](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview)** challenge on [CodeCrafters](https://codecrafters.io).  

## ðŸ“Œ About the Challenge  

[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) is the backbone of the web, enabling communication between clients and servers. In this challenge, I built an **HTTP/1.1 server** capable of handling multiple clients.  

### ðŸ§© What I Learned  
âœ” **How TCP servers work**  
âœ” **Understanding HTTP request handling** ([RFC 2616 - Section 5](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html))  
âœ” **Handling multiple connections**

## ðŸš€ Getting Started  

### âœ… Passing Stage 1  
The entry point for the HTTP server is in **`app/main.py`**. Uncomment the relevant code and push your changes to pass Stage 1:  

```sh
git commit -am "pass 1st stage"  
git push origin master
